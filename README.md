This project involves working with a dataset in Excel to perform the following tasks:

1- Data Cleaning:
Identify and address inconsistencies, missing values, and errors in the dataset.
Standardize formats (e.g., dates, text, numbers).
Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.

2-Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables:
Create Pivot Tables to summarize and analyze the cleaned dataset.
Extract meaningful insights by grouping, filtering, and visualizing key metrics.

3-Dashboard Creation:
Design a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Excel.
Use charts, slicers, and other visualization tools to display insights from the analysis.

This process ensures the dataset is accurate, insights are clear, and the dashboard effectively communicates the results.
